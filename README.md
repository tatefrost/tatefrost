### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

### My name Tate Frost and I am a software engineer who is eager and ready to learn everything and anything software! I am devoted to python development, specifically back end web development, however I am also very intrigued by cyber security and cryptography. I have worked in fast food and factories and am ready to make a change, I am currently attending DevMountain in hopes of working closely in the future with python back end based web applications and eventually working in the world of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain/ledgers which are all subjects I am passionate about. I use Javascript currently but will soon take on Python as my main programming language.
