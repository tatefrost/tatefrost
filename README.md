### Howdy 👋

### My name Tate Frost and I am a software engineer who is eager and ready to learn everything and anything software! Specifically, I am devoted to internet security and enjoy cryptography. I have worked in fast food and factories and am ready to make a change, I am currently attending DevMountain in hopes of working closely in the future with web security and eventually working in the world of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain which are two subjects I am passionate about. I use Javascript currently but will soon take on Python as my main programming language.
